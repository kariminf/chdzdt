# Morphology consistency datasets

The datasets are used for clustering taking the form: word \t cluster.
The first word in the cluster is the root and the rest are either inflections or derivations.
The raw data was downloaded from [UniMorph](https://unimorph.github.io/) project:
- Arabic: Since the source is under GPL license, we cannot redistribute the files. Instead, we share how to prepare them step by step.
- English and French: [https://github.com/kbatsuren/MorphyNet]() already under CC-BY-SA licence.
