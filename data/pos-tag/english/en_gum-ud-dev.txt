Introduction	NOUN
Research on adult - learned second language ( L2 ) has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar [ 1 ] – [ 11 ] .

Of interest here , studies suggest that , despite the difficulties in acquiring L2 grammar , adult learners can approximate native - like levels of use and neurocognitive processing [ 12 ] – [ 15 ] .

However , it is not enough to have attained such native - like levels .	ADV PUNCT PRON AUX PART ADJ PART AUX VERB ADJ ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT
Crucially , it is also desirable to retain them , even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2 .	ADV PUNCT PRON AUX ADV ADJ PART VERB PRON PUNCT ADV ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT
In fact , substantial periods ( months to years ) of limited or no exposure following L2 training are not uncommon , and may even be the norm [ 16 ] .

Such a scenario may be found in different situations , including when one studies a language in a classroom and then stops taking classes [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting and then moves away [ 19 ] .

In the present study , we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar : that is , whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and / or less native - like neural processes ( “ use it or lose it ” [ 20 ] ) , no such changes , or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and / or more native - like processing may be observed .

Previous Research	ADJ NOUN
We are aware of six studies designed to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult L2 training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 24 ] , all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral ( performance ) outcomes .

The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure , mainly on general language skills [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] or lexical abilities [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .

These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects who had not experienced a period of limited exposure [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects [ 21 ] , with only one longitudinal study testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure [ 24 ] .

Across the studies , the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] or mixed classroom and immersion training [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .

The training lasted varying lengths of time , apparently usually in the range of a few years , and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels ( though not directly measured , except by [ 24 ] ) prior to the period of limited exposure .

Overall , the results of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following .	ADV PUNCT DET NOUN ADP DET NUM NOUN AUX AUX VERB PART VERB DET VERB PUNCT
A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition ( loss ) of L2 performance or knowledge [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] .

Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month [ 23 ] or 6 month delay [ 21 ] , as well as after 2 years [ 18 ] , though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5 years , and not earlier [ 17 ] .

Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed : after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [ 24 ] , and observed in another study after 2 years , though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension [ 18 ] .

It remains unclear what might explain such gains , which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure [ 24 ] , or to factors related to general maturation , cognitive development , or continued academic training [ 18 ] .

It's It 's both a waiver and a modification , Justice Thomas .	_ PRON AUX DET DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT
This appears at JA 261 .	PRON VERB ADP PROPN NUM PUNCT
That was the decision document that the Secretary signed where he said , I hereby issue waivers and modifications of multiple provisions under Title IV of the student loan program .	PRON AUX DET NOUN NOUN PRON DET PROPN VERB ADV PRON VERB PUNCT PRON ADV VERB NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN NUM ADP DET NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT
And then that language was repeated in the Federal Register notice that actually implemented that program and constitutes the final agency action that the states are challenging here .	CCONJ ADV DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP DET ADJ PROPN NOUN PRON ADV VERB DET NOUN CCONJ VERB DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PRON DET NOUN AUX VERB ADV PUNCT
Well , could you explain then -- in -- in -- in other provisions , there is express language as to cancellation , and , of course , there isn't is n't here .	INTJ PUNCT AUX PRON VERB ADV PUNCT ADP PUNCT ADP PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB ADJ NOUN ADP ADP NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON _ VERB PART ADV PUNCT
So would you take a minute to explain how a waiver or modification amounts to a waiver -- to a cancellation ?	ADV AUX PRON VERB DET NOUN PART VERB ADV DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN PUNCT
Of course .	ADP NOUN PUNCT
So the Secretary identified various provisions in Title IV that govern the terms and conditions of student loans and also govern discharge and cancellation in other circumstances , as your question suggested .	INTJ DET PROPN VERB ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN NUM PRON VERB DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADV VERB NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT SCONJ PRON NOUN VERB PUNCT
And I think the straightforward way to think about how the verbs map onto the Secretary's Secretary 's action is that he waived elements of those provisions that contain eligibility requirements for discharge and cancellation that are inapplicable under this program and then modified the provisions to contain the limitations that he had announced as part and parcel of announcing this loan forgiveness .

Now you had suggested that there's there 's no express statement in the HEROES Act to discharge loan principal , and that's that 's true , but the relevant and operative language here is the provision that says the Secretary is empowered to waive or modify any Title IV provision , and so the HEROES Act isn't is n't enumerating any of the various forms of relief that have long been authorized and implemented under this statute .

I don't do n't think anything can be read into the fact that there's there 's no express reference to particular forms of relief because Congress was trying to broadly cover the field and ensure that the Secretary had the tools to respond to the national emergency with whatever relief might be necessitated .

He said it might be good English to say that the French Revolution modified the status of the French nobility , but only because there's there 's a figure of speech called understatement and a literary device known as sarcasm .

How does that fit under the normal understanding of " modifying " ?	ADV AUX PRON VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PUNCT
So , of course , I recognize that in MCI , Justice Scalia's Scalia 's opinion adopted a narrower understanding of that term , but I don't do n't read that opinion to set forth a universal meaning of " modify , " no matter the statutory context .

And , here , of course , we have a broader phrase , " waive or modify . "	CCONJ PUNCT ADV PUNCT ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT VERB CCONJ VERB PUNCT PUNCT
It's It 's undisputed and the states aren't are n't contesting that the ordinary meaning of " waive " means to eliminate an obligation in its entirety .	_ PRON AUX ADJ CCONJ DET NOUN _ AUX PART VERB SCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP PUNCT VERB PUNCT VERB PART VERB DET NOUN ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT
And I think , if you look at that phrase in the context of the statute , that means that " modify " has to mean making a change up to the point of wholesale elimination .

PRON AUX AUX ADV ADJ SCONJ PROPN PART VERB PRON AUX VERB NOUN ADV CCONJ VERB PRON ADV DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ PRON _ AUX PART VERB PRON ADP ADP PUNCT

And the reason I wish to clarify it is that you will hear the respondent's respondent 's counsel say waiver of tort is nothing new , that it's it 's an old cause of action .

But what I say that argument obscures is the fact that waiver of tort can be used in two quite different ways , and t- to refer to two different concepts .	CCONJ PRON PRON VERB DET NOUN VERB AUX DET NOUN SCONJ NOUN ADP NOUN AUX AUX VERB ADP NUM ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT CCONJ INTJ PART VERB ADP NUM ADJ NOUN PUNCT
The first is , it may refer to an old , old common law concept , a construct that would allow a plaintiff to obtain a gains based remedy but for a completed cause of action , and traditionally it was uh applied with respect to two causes of action , in particular proprietary causes of action and trespass or conversion .

But what I wish to emphasize is that that old construct was applied where the plaintiff could prove a completed cause of action .	CCONJ PRON PRON VERB PART VERB AUX SCONJ DET ADJ NOUN AUX VERB ADV DET NOUN AUX VERB DET VERB NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT
It remains an open question whether that construct should be expanded to allow for gains - based remedies for other types of claims .	PRON VERB DET ADJ NOUN SCONJ DET NOUN AUX AUX VERB PART VERB ADP NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT

So what I am asking you to decide today is the second -- relates to the second , and what I say is the new and much narrower meaning of of waiver of tort , which is what the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal did , which is to say there exists a cause of action that comprises a breach of a duty of care without causally linked loss or injury .

Smith offered three reasons .	PROPN VERB NUM NOUN PUNCT
First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage .	ADV PUNCT NOUN ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB NOUN PART VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADV PRON VERB DET NOUN PUNCT
( In later chapters , we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage . )	PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB DET NOUN SCONJ VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT

A similar pattern often operates within businesses .	DET ADJ NOUN ADV VERB ADP NOUN PUNCT
