Mandatory diversity trainings in professional settings , for example , are intended to reduce bias in the workplace by increasing the awareness of employees regarding the challenges facing minority group members .

More specifically , when analyzing weighted sample data employing the svy suite of commands in Stata the conventional Pearson χ2 statistic test of independence is converted into “ an F statistic with noninteger degrees of freedom by using a second - order Rao and Scott ( 1981 [ 22 ] , 1984 [ 23 ] ) correction ” .

The p - value associated with the design - based F is thus more accurate ( than the associated with the χ2 statistic ) given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the data .

Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax , and differentiates between primaries , secondaries , and tertiaries ; e.g. in " well honed phrase , " " phrase " is a primary , this being defined by a secondary , " honed " , which again is defined by a tertiary " well " .

The term Nexus is applied to sentences , structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation , in which two concepts are expressed in one unit ; e.g. , it rained , he ran indoors .

Well , Your Honor , I don't do n't think that it's it 's terribly important whether the word " punitive " is used , but I do think that any kinds of justifications which would justify the initial commitment are what I would call backward looking justifications , that is , justifications that do turn on the fact that he , it -- was found to have committed a criminal act beyond a reasonable doubt .

I believe that the law in the United States Court of Appeals in Brown against the United States and in Wade v.
